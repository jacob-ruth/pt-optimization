Problem Description:

Hyperparameters, start point

Simulated Annealing:

Temperature decay schedule
Number of swaps at each temperature
Number of swaps over time
Number of improvements at each temperature
Variance of the above between runs- hints if its consistent or not (high variance above means good for INS, maybe)
Best results

INS:

Temperatures, number of steps before swaps
Number of improvements for each temperature (how often each temperature triggered a swap)
Number of those over time (Could be interesting if the swaps were in clusters)
Behavior of the above over time (does the chain grow decoupled as it finds a local min? Or will te searchers not decouple it)
Best result
